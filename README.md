Employee Attrition Prediction Neural Network
Project Overview
This project develops a neural network model designed to help Human Resources (HR) departments predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. The model leverages historical employee data to identify patterns and factors that contribute to employee attrition, enabling proactive measures to improve retention rates.

Features
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes employee data to predict attrition likelihood.

Data Analysis: Includes scripts for preliminary data analysis and visualization to understand underlying trends and correlations.

Model Training and Evaluation: Provides a framework for training the neural network and evaluating its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.


Requirements
This project is implemented using Python, and requires the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Configuration
Modify the X_df and y_df files to adjust model parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs according to your needs.
